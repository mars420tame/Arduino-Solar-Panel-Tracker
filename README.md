# Arduino-Solar-Panel-Tracker
Arduino Solar Panel Tracker
This project is an Arduino-based solar panel tracker that adjusts the position of a solar panel to maximize its exposure to sunlight throughout the day.
The tracker utilizes light sensors to detect the sun's position and Arduino microcontrollers to control the movement of the solar panel.

Features:

Automatically adjusts the orientation of the solar panel to face the sun.
Improves the efficiency of solar energy collection by ensuring optimal exposure to sunlight.
Can be customized and adapted for different solar panel setups and locations.
Components:

Arduino microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Light sensors (e.g., LDRs or photodiodes)
Servo motors or stepper motors for panel movement
Solar panel mounting hardware
Usage:

Connect the light sensors to the Arduino microcontroller.
Mount the solar panel on the tracking mechanism.
Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
Power on the system and observe as the solar panel adjusts its position to face the sun.
Acknowledgements:

This project was inspired by the need for efficient solar energy harvesting and builds upon existing Arduino-based solar tracking systems.
